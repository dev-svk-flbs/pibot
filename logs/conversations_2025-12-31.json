    "llm_response": "Absolutely! Newtonian mechanics is all about how things move. There are three main principles that can help explain motion.\n\nFirst, an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a force. You can see this when you push a LEGO car; it moves because you applied a force.\n\nSecond, the force acting on an object equals its mass times acceleration (F equals ma). If you build a heavier LEGO car, it will need more force to move fast.\n\nLastly, for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Think about when you push off the ground to jump; you push down, and the ground pushes you up.\n\nHow about building a LEGO car to test these principles? What kind of design do you think would go fastest?",

F1 drivers train for years to learn how to handle the high speeds and complex controls. \n\nIn the meantime, you can build your own racing cars with LEGO and practice your engineering skills! You could even create a racetrack and time how fast your LEGO cars go. What kind of features would you include in your LEGO racetrack?",
